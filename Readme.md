# Lesson Plan Book Generator

Generates a teacher's lesson plan book for a school year from schedule data in a csv file. Uses a [jinja template](http://jinja.pocoo.org) to create a LaTeX file which can then be turned into a PDF with e.g. [pdftex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PdfTeX).

    usage: lpgen.py [-h] --cycles CYCLES [--input INPUT] --teacher TEACHER --year
                    YEAR

    Generates a LaTeX file with a teacher's lesson planner book for multiple week
    schedule cycles, prefilled with schedule data read from a csv file.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help         show this help message and exit
      --cycles CYCLES    number of schedule cycles to print
      --input INPUT      csv file with schedule data; will read from stdin in none
                         specified
      --teacher TEACHER  name of teacher to be printed on front page
      --year YEAR        school year (as string) to be printed on front page

Output is formatted for A4 paper with up to seven lessons per day and a two-week repeating schedule cycle ("A week" an "B week"). For other schedule structures the jinja template will have to be tweaked.

A sample schedule data input file is provided in `sample_schedule.csv`. The output generated by running

    ./lpgen.py --cycles 20 --input sample_schedule.csv --teacher "J. Keating" --year "2017-2018" > sample_schedule.tex && pdflatex sample_schedule.tex

is provided in `sample_schedule.pdf`.
